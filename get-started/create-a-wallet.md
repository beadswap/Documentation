# Create a Wallet

To get started on BeadSwap, the first thing you will need is to set up a wallet that supports Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\).

When you are setting up a wallet, follow the guide carefully and make sure you safely back up your recovery phrases.

We recommend the below wallets for simple setup and ease of use:
