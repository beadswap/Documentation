## Listing on the Exchange

### How can I list my token on the exchange?

Anybody can "list" any BEP-20 network token on PancakeSwap. You don't need to contact us or ask permission. You just need to [add liquidity to a liquidity pool]() - that's it. Traders can then trade your token by entering your token's contract address.

### How can I add my token to the default list?

You need to launch a Syrup Pool or IFO in order to be added to the list. See above.

We don't accept requests to add tokens to the approved list. 

### How can I add my token's logo/icon?

PancakeSwap's exchange references Trust Wallet's excellent assets collection for icons. Please add your icon here: [https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)

## Something else

You can shoot us an email at pancakeswap@gmail.com if the above parts don't cover your questions really don't help you. Please don't try to contact us via this email for [customer support](), that's not what it's for: your best option for getting help with the product is via the [Telegram or Reddit community]().
