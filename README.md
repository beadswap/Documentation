# BeadSwap Intro

### BeadSwap helps you make the most out of your crypto in three ways:

### Trade & Earn.

## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### The people's choice

BeadSwap is the leading decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, with the highest trading volumes in the market 

### Low fees

Why pay more? BeadSwap runs on Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin. Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app. Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, BeadSwap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## 💸 Earn

> Earn BEAD and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools \(LPs\).
